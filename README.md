## About

are 'friends' electric? closed out the minimal week, this one was of course inspired by Tubeway Army with their song of the same name.

For this I wanted to capture something that was both print and digital inspired. We have the halftones and offsets of printing, and the slight cyan, yellow and megenta ink combining to make black. Meanwhile it firmly has it's foot in digital with the slowly moving circles, representing the movement of abstract trains in a underground 'tube-map'. This is about as far from minimal as I wanted to get, a fairly dynamic artwork, with gentle animation.
